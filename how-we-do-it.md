# How we do it

## Our model

### Bring everyone in
- Form strong steering committees which consist of the main project stakeholders
- Proactively reach out to various user groups and gather inputs
- Make information about the project accessible and easy to understand

### Understanding needs

We begin our projects by conducting interviews and gathering requirements Begin projects by conducting research with real people to understand who they are, what they need, and how they behave. Design programs and services around those needs, continuously test with users, and refine policy and processes accordingly. Learn more about User Centered Design, including how to:
- Develop your research plan
