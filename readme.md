Making the Future of Government Work Better for You


The way we do things is rapidly changing. Technology has empowered people to have positive impacts on their lives and their communities. What if governments and government services did the same with accessible, easy to use, and effective software? LSF is on a mission to make governments work better for you in today’s digital age.

## Code For Sri Lanka

LSF is helping the Government of Sri Lanka architect, build and deploy technology to improve governance and the quality of services provided to citizens. Code For Sri Lanka will:

1. Partner with government to create scalable and secure open source solutions
2. Help various government organizations architect proper digital solutions for themselves in alignment with the long-term goals of a digital Sri Lanka.
3. Enable organizations to build open source software solutions that can be taken to other countries.

Code for Sri Lanka also envisions working with organizations beyond the government to help improve the country’s operations and governance.
